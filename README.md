# GithubUser (work in progress)

A sample project designed and built similar to most tech challenge tasks.

It fetches data from **Github** [search](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search) and [user details](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users) APIs and show it to the user in list and detailed screens.

## Dependencies (incomplete)
- [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - REST Client for Android and Java.
- [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) -  Fast and efficient image loading.
- [Okhttp3 Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor) - An OkHttp interceptor which logs HTTP request and response data (used with Retrofit).
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - To convert Java objects to JSON and back (used with Retrofit).
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - Logger with a small, extensible API providing utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
